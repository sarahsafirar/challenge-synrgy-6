# CHALLENGE 7 | React APP

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tool for kickstarting React applications.

## Available Scripts

In your project directory, you can execute the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The page will automatically reload upon changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder. This process optimizes the build for better performance, including minification and hashing of filenames. Your app is then ready for deployment. For more information, check the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there is no going back!**

If you are dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project. From this point onward, you have full control over them. It's important to note that you don't have to use `eject`; the curated feature set is suitable for most deployments.
